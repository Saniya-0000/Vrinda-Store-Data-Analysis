# Vrinda Store Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive sales analysis of Vrinda Store for the year 2022**. Using the provided dataset (`Vrinda_Store_Data_Analysis.xlsx`), we analyze sales trends, customer demographics, regional contributions, and channel performance to derive actionable business insights.

The analysis helps answer questions such as:

* Which months generated the highest sales and orders?
* Who are the primary customers (gender, age group)?
* Which states contribute the most to sales?
* What is the overall order fulfillment status?
* Which online channels drive the highest sales?
